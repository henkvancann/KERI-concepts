[[def:Repair the internet, MB]]
~ The original design of the Internet Protocol (IP) has no security layer(s), providing no built-in mechanism for secure attribution to the source of an IP packet. Anyone can forge an IP packet, and a recipient may not be able to ascertain when or if the packet was sent by an imposter. This means that secure attribution mechanisms for the Internet must be overlaid.
